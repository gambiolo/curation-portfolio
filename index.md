### so here is a list of the few collabs we did, sometimes as writer, photographer, speaker, lecturer, curator, mentor, workshop facilitator etc...

## FSCONS: [The Free Society Conference](https://fscons.org/2015/schedule/?ltclid=2738ed23-fc47-41f7-bee6-1e759b5857f5) (Sweden)

A meeting place for social change, focused on the intersection between technology, culture and society. The conference brings together people from a wide range of fields, and merges the technical with the social, seeking both to activate and challenge. Your input in open discussion and brainstorming are as important as the talks given during the conference.

## KOBE 078 [How to invent the futur](https://2018.078kobe.jp/events/5576/index.html?ltclid=c1ee619e-f6af-4176-94d6-176d1b0541fd) (Japan)

Conference and workshops on high technology and biotechnology based in Kobe, we had the chance to give a lecture just before legendary Detroit techno band  aka Underground Resistance (UR) who was playing alongside with very interesting Japanese artists and forward thinkers...we even met Gil Scott Heron's niece backstage (only in Japan).

## Oxford talk [on Biohacking](https://new.talks.ox.ac.uk/talks/id/a449c919-352e-4a01-8055-d8abb744312a/?ltclid=66e994b5-4475-4759-8824-d9136422bd3f)  (England)

We presented in front of a class of University students curious about underground ecosystems working with technology and biology, Alongside LabGenius and OxSyBio, when the corporate world collides with research funds and entreprenarial mindset.

## Fab Foundation [on biohacking](https://fab10.org/en/fab-festival?ltclid=512955c3-e132-4e76-87bb-5715fd8abe4f) (Spain)

Fab foundation is the biggest american tool for collonizing the world with the american maker mindset, entreprenarial, DIY, Tinkering with technology (consuming) especially, tight with academic funds from the MIT and DARPA (the military research program for innovation, also the people behind the internet as we know today) also if you are curious about [biomaterials we wrote a little something](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/biodesign-and-biomaterials-2e676c92a604) Once again the american collonial strcuture of the maker innovation and californian ideology with smart grid and smart everything sweat the shit out of these narrative.

## SXSW [Biohacking Safari vs MIT Medialab](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/sxsw-is-crazy-synbio-is-here-to-stay-5ae40a1c5fbf?ltclid=e2ae4d68-35bf-43e2-b60a-a09926ffebfd) (Texas)

Long story short we did collab with the [MIT Medialab](link) basicaly We found out that most kids accepting grants from MIT medialab have never been trained in any critical or political theories, engineers and artists virgin in thoughts with potentialy life changing biotechnologies in hands. Decolonizing knowledge becomes key when you want to make people trust science again. Accepting money from Darpa, Epstein or Gates foundation comes with a high price, and ho boy they did payed alot, never the less we had enormous joy collaborating with them, beside their priviledges and weird acces to funding, they are the futur of science, hopefully they dont get lost in academia too long.

## DimSumLab [Hacker space and Biohacking](https://www.dimsumlabs.com/2016/02/05/hackjam-2nd-february-2016/) (Hong-Kong)

After our little trip In CHina we had to get to Hong Kong to meet some real hackers that drink CLub Maté (way what? in HK?) SO we did drink club maté and presented our little expeditions to fairly underground intimist crowd. Lovely people and home brew project, every social space where knowledge is shared should home brew what ever, pickles, beer, wine, lacto fermentation matter.

## Maker media vs Biohacking Safari [and maker faire curator](https://makezine.com/author/biohacking-safari?ltclid=aa4158d8-cc99-42fe-9964-55bcb3286b81) (San Francisco) 

We played with maker media for a while because we was living and studying the Black Panther movement in Oakland. Maker culture and gov/military fundings goes hand to hand with journalistic values, we have been warned that it was a much Californian ideology colonising worldwide the maker movement (to make the word a better place). We mostly studyed the deep and cute roots of Californian ideology, we even been to Burning Man visiting the maker religious silicon valley spirit of crashing and destroying cars and dancing on drug music. they should under dose not microdose.

## IGEM the syntetic [biologic competion vs Biohacking](https://www.makery.info/en/2014/11/04/le-fromage-vegan-gagne-le-1er-prix-open-labs-de-ligem/) (Boston) 

Most of wealthy univesities in the world send their students to a biosynth competition every year in Boston. Evry year the same game they go take selfies with FBI agents and they might even get a job at Monsanto or Bayer who have their representators near by, we collected datas and [worked for french press](https://www.nouvelobs.com/sciences/20141114.OBS5090/ces-biohackers-qui-jouent-aux-lego-avec-l-adn-des-bacteries.html), their notions of open source and transparency is very opaque and the food and music they serve during the event is proabably the worse food one can have in his life. We even did a [crowdfunding campaing](https://www.kisskissbankbank.com/fr/projects/biohacking-safari-on-tour) to get there, real nightmare to say the least, th edefinition of how to corrupt kids at  young age.

## Shenzhen Journey - [Tsinghua University vs Biohacking](https://medium.com/@dailylaurel/shenzhen-journey-at-tsinghua-university-d4f7865b9da6) (China)
What an amazing culture, also collonized by american maker culture, we learned that people do not want cars in Shenzen but a smartphone, We had the chance to mentor the elite of Chinese students, they are curious and brillant overall, the mix with French students from the center transdisciplnary research in Paris was all we needed to get a grasp of how  We also discovered activists from Hong-Kong where British collonialism still prevail, the banking system HSBC was created there during the Opium war with England and China, nowadays its more electronic part than opium that is beeing traded, the mighty drug of the 21st century. 


## GOSH the open society for [open science vs Biohacking](https://openhardware.science/gosh-manifesto/french/) (Chile)

We had no idea our names was written here, perhaps the swiss academic system just needed legitimacy from the underground societies from all parts of the world, or maybe it was just a marketing campaign to still give money to research, because frankly promoting open source ideology and transparency might actualy hide the whole collonial matrix of how knowledge is produced since the enlightment in Europe. And marx might pop up in one discussion or two but not the french nor the german critical theorists will do anything about it...if its possible to take our name, decolonising knowledge might takes more than organising cute events with lab rats who never realy lived outside their universities.

## The P2P foundation vs [Biohacking](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Biohacking_Safari) (Belgium)

We never asked to be mentionned on this website but they also needed legitimacy from the public sector. The P2P foundation is interesting but verry much tighed with white collonial mindset, we have seen more and more comment about masculine dominant narratives and survivalist and libertarians on the edge of conservatism. It would be cool to take off the mention of our non profit...ho well Biohacking Safari actualy sound like a collonial structure, perhpas it deserve a place here after all.


## Edge Ryders vs [Biohacking in Morocco](https://edgeryders.eu/t/candidate-houses-for-the-reef-morocco/7171/5?ltclid=8d35c63d-9926-4c56-b104-6f52dfbe9ca3) (Morocco)

It started as a cool project but it quickly escalated in unwanted consequences, the goal was to find an ecosystem for gathering people from the arab world (Tunisia, Lybia, Syria, Egypt etc..) This project was sponsored by edge Ryders but the money came from the World Bank. As usual our name should not legitimize these power structures and we explained to edgeryders organisation that our name should not appear on some publicities or waht so ever, unfortunatly they did a whole website explaining who we was and a big logo of world bank was appearing under our names. SO we did what we had to do, and we did it with love.


## Waag Society in [Amsterdam vs biohacking](https://waag.org/nl/article/open-wetlab-sxsw-austin-texas?ltclid=8bc55cb2-df66-4478-9b9a-1a2e45af3401) (Netherland)

one of the first collective (with barcelona) to have had a FABLAB inside a city, here near the prostitue area (the red quarter of Amsterdam) we felt into the american ideology of the maker culture via these europeen academic design structure, loaded with tons of money from europeen fundings and Dutch research money, they are the greatest europeen colloniser in terms of design and biomaterial, we drink beers with them in festivals and we follow each other but the matrix of collonial structures smells as high as the cannabis that floats around this verry collonial city, brillant people never the less (hopefully)


## Osons La France vs [Biohacking vs Macron](https://gambiolo.github.io/Tortuga/)

At the time the french president was at ''le ministere de l'économie'' in Bercy, he invited loads of us from Paris creative expressive workers, engineers, and scientist of all fields to talk about our researches. We were surrounded by the elite of the finest capitalist french industrials (Sanofi, Blablacar, SNCF etc..). The event was a trap, indeed we had to talk in front of a camera that was pointed as us AND 2 logos of the journals (We demain) and the biotech company (Roche) behind us. The futur president Macron was fishing electors and trying to get us to legitimate his futur to come presidency. The french tech was starting to influence politics with the californian ideology and silicon valley mindset (Break stuff & disrupt) here a [video of the trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOPywdaeE8) we wish our president had more experience in politics than his childish extreme positions for social policies.
