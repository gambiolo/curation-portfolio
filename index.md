Check out our decolonized approach toward open source researches, and how to expect creating communities when the roots of academia is entangled with such collonial matrix, more on that subject here > [GAMBIOLOGITS](https://gambiolo.github.io/decolonizing-biohackingsafari/) #PardonMyFrench

## FSCONS: [The Free Society Conference](https://fscons.org/2015/schedule/?ltclid=2738ed23-fc47-41f7-bee6-1e759b5857f5) (Sweden)

A meeting place for social change, focused on the intersection between technology, culture and society. The conference brings together people from a wide range of fields, and merges the technical with the social, seeking both to activate and challenge. Your input in open discussion and brainstorming are as important as the talks given during the conference.

## KOBE 078 [How to invent the futur](https://2018.078kobe.jp/events/5576/index.html?ltclid=c1ee619e-f6af-4176-94d6-176d1b0541fd) (Japan)

Conference and workshops on high technology and biotechnology based in Kobe, we had the chance to give a lecture just before legendary Detroit techno band  aka Underground Resistance (UR) who was playing alongside with very interesting Japanese artists and forward thinkers from all over the world, some people say it's the new sxsw...we even met Gil Scott Heron's niece backstage (only in Japan).

## Oxford talk [on Biohacking](https://new.talks.ox.ac.uk/talks/id/a449c919-352e-4a01-8055-d8abb744312a/?ltclid=66e994b5-4475-4759-8824-d9136422bd3f)  (England)

We presented in front of a class of University students curious about underground ecosystems working with technology and biology, Alongside LabGenius and OxSyBio, when the corporate world collides with research funds and entreprenarial mindset in the futur elites of the british empirialism, we talked about how the common wealth was influencing the whole world throught science and how knowledge was created since the enlightment.

## Fab Foundation [on biohacking](https://fab10.org/en/fab-festival?ltclid=512955c3-e132-4e76-87bb-5715fd8abe4f) (Spain)

Fab foundation is the biggest american tool for collonizing the world with the american maker mindset, entreprenarial, DIY, Tinkering with technology (consuming) especially, tight with academic funds from the MIT and DARPA (the military research program for innovation. If you are curious about [biomaterials we wrote a little something](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/biodesign-and-biomaterials-2e676c92a604) Once again the american collonial strcuture of the maker innovation and californian ideology with smart grid and smart everything sweat the shit out of these narrative and is invading biohacking lately...fucking yankees

## SXSW [Biohacking Safari vs MIT Medialab](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/sxsw-is-crazy-synbio-is-here-to-stay-5ae40a1c5fbf?ltclid=e2ae4d68-35bf-43e2-b60a-a09926ffebfd) (Texas)

Long story short we did collab with the [MIT Medialab](https://gambiolo.github.io/tainted-transparency/) and basicaly we found out that most kids accepting grants from the institution are virgin in thoughts with a career to fullfill what ever the cost. Decolonizing how knowledge is produced within academia 



## DimSumLab [Hacker space and Biohacking](https://www.dimsumlabs.com/2016/02/05/hackjam-2nd-february-2016/) (Hong-Kong)

After our little trip In CHina we had to get to Hong Kong to meet some real hackers that drink CLub Maté (way what? in HK?) SO we did drink club maté and presented our little expeditions to fairly underground intimist crowd. Lovely people and home brewer, every social space where knowledge is shared should host a bioreactor for homegrewing that is pickles, beer, wine etc...

## Maker media vs Biohacking Safari [and maker faire curator](https://makezine.com/author/biohacking-safari?ltclid=aa4158d8-cc99-42fe-9964-55bcb3286b81) (San Francisco) 

We played with maker media for a while because we was living and studying the Black Panther movement in Oakland. Maker culture and gov/military fundings goes hand to hand with journalistic values, we have been warned that it was a much Californian eligious ideology colonising worldwidebut we wanted to check for ourselves. We mostly studied the deep roots of silicon valley ideology, we even went to Burning Man to dig deeper onto the new technical religion of crypto punks and steampunk godesses. Often too much money brings awefull music, unless you microdose lsd.

## IGEM the syntetic [biologic competion vs Biohacking](https://www.makery.info/en/2014/11/04/le-fromage-vegan-gagne-le-1er-prix-open-labs-de-ligem/) (Boston) 

Most of wealthy univesities in the world send their students to a biosynthetic competition every year in Boston. Evry year the same game they go take selfies with FBI agents and Monsanto or Bayer's representatives. We collected itws and [worked with french press](https://www.nouvelobs.com/sciences/20141114.OBS5090/ces-biohackers-qui-jouent-aux-lego-avec-l-adn-des-bacteries.html), their notions of open source and transparency was very opaque and the food and music they serve during the event is proabably the worse food one can have in his life. We even did a [crowdfunding campaing](https://www.kisskissbankbank.com/fr/projects/biohacking-safari-on-tour) to get there, if you want to study how to corrupt kids at young age with fascists and neoliberal narrative go there, the director of IGEM even says to the students that everyone one in the room will get its own jet plane. Ho also they want to make the world a better place. Overall some science posters are interesting, some teams come up with verry strange ideas that are getting forked by others. IGEM is American ideology inna nutshell

## Shenzhen Journey - [Tsinghua University vs Biohacking](https://medium.com/@dailylaurel/shenzhen-journey-at-tsinghua-university-d4f7865b9da6) (China)
What an amazing culture, also collonized by american maker culture, but we learned that people do not want cars in Shenzen but a smartphone and electric bikes, We had the chance to mentor the elite of Chinese students, they are curious and brillant overall, the mix with French students from the center for transdisciplnary research in Paris was all we needed to get a grasp of how Chinese culture will shape futur societies. We also discovered activists from Hong-Kong where we earned that British collonialism still prevail, that the banking system HSBC was created there during the Opium war between England and China, but that nowadays its more electronic part than opium that is beeing traded.


## GOSH the open society for [open science vs Biohacking](https://openhardware.science/gosh-manifesto/french/) (Chile)

We had no idea our names was written here, perhaps the swiss academic system just needed legitimacy from the underground societies that we visited, or maybe it was just a marketing campaign to still give money to research, because frankly promoting open source ideology and transparency in 2021 feels like hiding the whole collonial matrix of how knowledge is produced since the enlightment in Europe.

## The P2P foundation vs [Biohacking](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Biohacking_Safari) (Belgium)

We never asked to be mentionned on this website but they also needed legitimacy from the public sector. The P2P foundation is interesting but verry much tighed with these white male collonial narratives. The more we stayed aroudn these people the more it was clear that a large part of them where inot  this libertarians narratives with a pinch of survivalism on the edge of conservatism. It would be cool to take off the mention of our non profit...ho well Biohacking Safari actualy sound like a collonial structure, perhpas it deserve a place here after all.


## Edge Ryders vs [Biohacking in Morocco](https://edgeryders.eu/t/candidate-houses-for-the-reef-morocco/7171/5?ltclid=8d35c63d-9926-4c56-b104-6f52dfbe9ca3) (Morocco)

It started as a cool project but it quickly escalated in unwanted consequences, the goal was to find an ecosystem for gathering people from the arab world (Tunisia, Lybia, Syria, Egypt etc..) This project was sponsored by edge Ryders but the money came from the World Bank. As usual our name should not legitimize these power structures and we explained to edgeryders organisation that our name should not appear on some marketed WB campain. Unfortunatly they did a whole website explaining who we was with a big logo of world bank was appearing under our names. SO we did what we had to do, and we did it with love.


## Waag Society in [Amsterdam vs biohacking](https://waag.org/nl/article/open-wetlab-sxsw-austin-texas?ltclid=8bc55cb2-df66-4478-9b9a-1a2e45af3401) (Netherland)

one of the first collective (with barcelona) to have had a FABLAB inside a city, here near the prostitue area (the red quarter of Amsterdam) we felt into the american ideology of the maker culture via these europeen academic design structure tightly connected to american academic ideologies. Loaded with tons of money from europeen fundings and Dutch design/architecture money, they are the greatest europeen colloniser in terms of biomaterial and biodesign, we drink beers with them at festivals and we follow each other but the matrix of collonial structures smells as high as the cannabis that floats around this verry collonial city, brillant people never the less.


## Osons La France vs [Biohacking vs Macron](https://www.genopole.eu/IMG/pdf/dp_osons_la_france.pdf) (France)

At the time the french president was ''ministere de l'économie'' in Bercy, he invited loads of us from Paris creative expressive workers, engineers, and scientists of all fields to talk about our researches. We were surrounded by the elite of french industrials (Sanofi, Blablacar, SNCF etc..). The event was a trap, indeed we had to talk in front of a camera that was pointed as us AND 2 logos of the journals (We demain wich i was working for) and the biotech company (Roche wich also sponsored part of our lab) behind us. The futur president Macron was fishing electors and trying to get us to legitimate his futur to come presidency. The french tech was starting to influence politics with the californian ideology and silicon valley mindset (Break stuff & disrupt) here a [video of the trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOPywdaeE8).
